The module =prime= provides predicates to test (positive integer) numbers
for primality, find divisors and factor numbers, generate prime numbers in
some interval, find consecutive prime numbers, and save/load all prime
numbers up to some value to/from a file or stream.

Implements a variant of the *Miller-Rabin* primality test that is
_deterministic_ for numbers up to =3317044064679887385961980=, otherwise
it is _probabilistic_ with the number of iterations fixed at =20=.  For
better performance, leverages a prime wheel of level =4= and memoization.

All predicates in module =prime= are _safe_, i.e. validate input arguments
and ensure steadfastness.  For maximum performance, user code can directly
call the _unsafe_ =public= (not exported) predicates in sub-module
=prime_lgc=.

*NOTE*: Since the primality test in use is _probabilistic_ in general, this
library is not suitable for cryptographic applications.

This library was developed and tested with:
SWI-Prolog 7.3.24: http://www.swi-prolog.org/

Example:

	==
	?- pack_install(nan_numerics_prime).
	true.
	
	?- use_module(library(nan_numerics_prime)).
	true.

	?- time(prime_right(1234567891012345678901234567890123456789011111,P)).
	% 1,205 inferences, 0.000 CPU in 0.000 seconds (?% CPU, Infinite Lips)
	P = 1234567891012345678901234567890123456789011139.
	=

To be done: Implement prime counting/n-th prime functions.
To be done: Implement probabilitic test error estimates?
To be done: Implement deterministic tests (elliptic curves)?
